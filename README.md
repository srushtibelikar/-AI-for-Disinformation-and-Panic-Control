🧠 AI for Disinformation and Panic Control

📌 Overview

This project focuses on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect, analyze, and counter disinformation and panic-inducing content across digital platforms. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and fake news detection models, the system helps reduce misinformation and ensures the spread of trustworthy information.

🚀 Features

🔍 Disinformation Detection – Identifies false or misleading news, posts, and media.

🧾 Sentiment Analysis – Detects panic-inducing or fear-spreading content.

🛡️ Fake News Classification – Uses machine learning models to classify real vs. fake content.

📊 Dashboard (optional) – Visualization of detected patterns and trends.

📢 Reliable Info Dissemination – Provides fact-checked and verified sources.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Primary language)

NLP Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Transformers (BERT/DistilBERT)

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib / Plotly

(Optional): Flask/Django for web deployment


📂 Dataset (Examples)

LIAR Dataset – Fake news classification
